Pokemon

</h1>
<p>
I wanna be the very best<br />
Like no one ever was<br />
To catch them is my real test<br />
To train them is my cause<br />

I will travel across the land<br />
Searching far and wide<br />
Each Pokemon to understand<br />
The power that's inside<br />

Its you and me<br />
I know it's my destiny<br />
Pokemon, oh, you're my best friend<br />
In a world we must defend<br />
Pokemon, gotta catch 'em all<br />
A heart so true<br />
Our courage will pull us through<br />

You teach me and I'll teach you<br />
Pokemon, gotta catch 'em all<br />
Gotta catch 'em all<br />
Yeah<br />

Every challenge along the way<br />
With courage I will face<br />
I will battle every day<br />
To claim my rightful place<br />

Come with me, the time is right<br />
There's no better team<br />
Arm in arm we'll win the fight<br />
It's always been our dream<br />

Pokemon, gotta catch 'em all<br />
Its you and me<br />
I know it's my destiny<br />
Pokemon, oh, you're my best friend<br />
In a world we must defend<br />
Pokemon, gotta catch 'em all<br />
A heart so true<br />
Our courage will pull us through<br />

You teach me and I'll teach you<br />
Pokemon, gotta catch 'em all<br />
Gotta catch 'em all<br />
Gotta catch 'em all<br />
Gotta catch 'em all<br />
Yeah
