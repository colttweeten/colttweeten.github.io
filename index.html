Pokemon
<b/>
</h1>
<p>
I wanna be the very best<br />
Like no one ever was<br />
To catch them is my real test<br />
To train them is my cause<br />

I will travel across the land<br />
Searching far and wide<br />
Each Pokemon to understand<br />
The power that's inside<br />

Its you and me<br />
I know it's my destiny<br />
Pokemon, oh, you're my best friend<br />
In a world we must defend<br />
Pokemon, gotta catch 'em all<br />
A heart so true<br />
Our courage will pull us through<br />

You teach me and I'll teach you<br />
Pokemon, gotta catch 'em all<br />
Gotta catch 'em all<br />
Yahoo<br />
<h2 id="part2">Part 2</h2>
Every challenge along the way<br />
With courage I will face<br />
I will battle every day<br />
To claim my rightful place<br />

Come with me, the time is right<br />
There's no better team<br />
Arm in arm we'll win the fight<br />
It's always been our dream<br />

Pokemon, gotta catch 'em all<br />
Its you and me<br />
I know it's my destiny<br />
Pokemon, oh, you're my best friend<br />
In a world we must defend<br />
Pokemon, gotta catch 'em all<br />
A heart so true<br />
Our courage will pull us through<br />

You teach me and I'll teach you<br />
Pokemon, gotta catch 'em all<br />
Gotta catch 'em all<br />
Gotta catch 'em all<br />
Gotta catch 'em all<br />
Yeah

<h3>Information</h3>

This song was written and produced by John Loeffler in 1999. A lucky few heard it in 1998 but it didn't get famous until 1999 when the show was released.The lead vocal was sung by Jason Paige in english.<br />
Paige became popular from singing this song but actually knew nothing about pokemon when he did the demo. Then he got the job and soon learned everything about pokemon.<br />

<h4>Strange facts</h4>
<p>Most pokemon can only have a combination of two types but if there was a pokemon that had all the types it would be invicible right?<br />
Wrong. Rock types would still be super effective on it.<br />
<br />
The name pokemon isn't japenese at all. It's actually a combination of pocket and monster.<br ?>
<br />
The three legendary birds Aritcuno, Zapdos, and Moltres all have the number 1,2, and 3 in them but in spanish. Uno, Dos, and Tres.</p>
