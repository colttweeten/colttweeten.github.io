<h2><b>Information</b></h2>

<p>The Pokerap's contributors were R&B singer James "D-train" Williams who was responsible for the hook. John Siegler was the music director at 4Kids Entertainment.<br />
Sadly Babi Floyd the original rapper of the Pokerap died but they all worked together to finish the song. Thus they made the rap and named all the first pokemons.<br />
</p>

<h3><b>Strange Facts</b></h3>

<p>Arcanine was originally supposed to be a legendary pokemon but was replaced by Moltres.<br />
The pokemon Ditto was actually a failed attempt of mew. They can both learn any move, transform, and weigh 8.8 lbs.<br />
Meowth and Pikachu were made to be complete oppisites since they were to resemble a mouse and cat. Even their pokedex numbers are oppisites.
